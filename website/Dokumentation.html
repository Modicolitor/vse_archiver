			The VSE Archiver is a Blender addon supposed to produce a back-up of your video project. It will create an Archive Folder you specify, collects all the footage used into a destinct folder structure and relinks all media in the new blend file created in the folder. This results in a handy BackUp Folder which includes only the media used consolidated into an ordered folder structure ready to be archived or send to a customer demanding the project files. 
			<ul> 
				<li>Footage distributed over your system will end up in a clean folder structure.</li>
				<li>Project size will be decreased because only the used footage will be collected</li>
				<li>Decide whether you want to copy the original footage or render the indiviudal strips</li>
				<li>Footage includes Images, Imagesequences, Video, Audio and Fonts which will be found either used in vse strips or mentioned in the blend data </li>

 <h3 style="text-align: left;">Main Modes</h3>

			The VSE Archiver offers two different approaches of archiving your footage: 
		 	<ol> 
				<li> Collect Sources: Copies the original source media </li>
				<li> Collect Snippets: (primarily) Renders sequence strips and save them in the Archive Folder. However, copy or render can be decided either per media type or per strip</li>
			</ol>
			Both Modes allow different functions to be adjusted to your liking and will be discussed in the following. 
		 </div>		
 	</div>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Collect Sources</h3>

<div class="row">

	</div>
 

 	<div class="col-lg-8 col-sm-12 nextTo">
		 <div>	

			This mode is used to archive all original source files by copying them into the archive folder and relink them. Imagine the case where you filmed 10h hours, but only used 3 min of the material. There will be a lot unused material. Use this option to get an archive with only the used footage and get rid of the shaky shots you dared to delete, but eventually never used.

		<h4 style="text-align: left;">Pro</h4>
			
				<li>Is a source file used in several sequencer strips it is only copied once</li>
				<li>No quality lost due to rendering </li>
				<li>Effect strips stay untouched and adjustable</li>
			
	</div>
	<div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
			<h4 style="text-align: left;">Contra</h4>
			
				<li>If only small portions of very long video files are used a lot more data than necessary is archived</li>

				<li><b>Rebuild Blend File</b>: when this is checked the active blend file will be saved into the archive and all footage is relinked. When unchecked only the source material is copied into the archive. </li>
				<li><b>Include Blend Data</b>: Blender sometimes saves links to video related media in the blend data of the file. When checked the addon will look for Images, Imagesequences, Video, Audio and Fonts and save them in the archive. Important for example when: 1 . you do compositor stuff (colorgrading, stabilizing footage, vfx) in another scene via the compositor and use a scene strip in the vse 2. You used another font then blender default 3. You use the scene strip of simple 3D scene with image textures… </li>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Collect Snippets</h3>

<div class="row">

	<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12">
		The Collect Snippets mode is primarily designed to render individual strips into video files. However, you can decide per type or for the individual sequence whether you want it to be rendered or the source files copied. For example in most cases it doesnot make sense to render a video from a single image. The source should be copied instead. An image sequence might be more handy to be archived as video file. Individual setting overwrites the type setting. 
		<h4 style="text-align: left;">Generalsettings</h4>
		<ul> 
			
			<li><b>Include Blend Data</b>:(same as above) when this is checked the active blend file will be saved into the archive and all footage is relinked. When unchecked only the source material is copied into the archive. </li>
			<li><b>Rebuild Blendfile</b>:(same as above) Blender sometimes saves links to video related media in the blend data of the file. When checked the addon will look for Images, Imagesequences, Video, Audio and Fonts and save them in the archive. Important for example when: 1 . you do compositor stuff (colorgrading, stabilizing footage, vfx) in another scene via the compositor and use a scene strip in the vse 2. You used another font then blender default 3. You use the scene strip of simple 3D scene with image textures… </li></li>
			<li><b>Full Opacity during Render</b>: When this checkbox is activated the addon will remove the alpha fade of the sequencer strips for rendering and add them back to the newly rendered and replaced strip.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 style="text-align: left;">Settings by type</h4>
		
			<li><b>Image, Imagesequence, Movie, Audio</b>: decide whether sequences of that type are rendered or the source files are copied.</li>
			<li><b>Metastrips</b>: can be rendered as one strip or the inside is handled as individual strips</li>
			<li><b>Scene strips</b>: can be rendered or ignored</li>
		
		<h4 style="text-align: left;">Individual Settings</h4>
		<div>
		When you select a sequence (active sequence) you can set copy or render (or for scene or meta strips as mentioned in settings by type) for this specific sequence. The individual setting will overwrite the settings set by type. 

		<li><b>Update Sequence Data</b>: The addon collects information about the sequences when initialized. When you add or remove sequences, this data needs to be updated by clicking this button. An information text will appear, when this is necessary </li>
		<li><b>Reset Sequence Data</b>: Resets all individual strip settings to the settings defined by type </li>

		 	There are 4 types of connector modes. 
		 	<ul>
				<li>Stick</li>
				<li>Male-Female (mf)</li>
				<li>Flat</li>
				<li>Planar</li>
		 	</ul>
		 	We saw a mf-connector in the first example. After applying, one of the resulting objects will be male and one will be female.%Stick mode will generate two female daughter objects and an additional 'Stick'-Object to connect both. Having the stick as an additional part can be beneficial. For example, you need to reprint less (only the stick), if your oversize value is off. We'll talk about oversize later. Flat is actually just a stupid plane. It cuts two things in half without any connector. Still can be useful if you want to glue stuff together anyway. Planar is a whole new world, compared to the other modes. Mathematically speaking (or was it topologically, geographically) the functionallity is here parallel to the maincut and not perpendicular like in the first two cases. Moreover, a planar can generate a large number of couplings with one object while the first two only produce one coupling. That's why I'll call the first 3 modes Stick, MF and Flat  (yeah, I know flat doesn't...bla) Single Connector Modes and the other is multiconnectors... ok they are called  planar  .... for consistency ... you'll get it... later... maybe.

		 <div>	
		 	When you select a Connector several colorful symbols appear around the connecotor's origin (only avaiable when the addon is installed and initalized). These are controls to change several settings and, hence, the appearance of the connector. From bottom to top:
		 	
		 	<ul>
		 		<li> Transparency is not available in most videoformats. </li>
				<li>Audio strips will be rendered as video file due to blenders (or mine?) inability to render mp3, wav or similar audio files. The addon will show a warning when the render format is not </li>
			 	<li>Rendered movie strips will be without audio. This can only be avoided by packaging both together in a metastrip to get the video file with its audio</li>
			 	<li>strips will be ignored for rendering </li>
			 	<li>The addon will not delete files. However, the addon will overwrite all files in its way (same path and file names). Thus, we strongly recommend using an empty folder as new archive destination. We are not responsible for any data lost. </li>
			 	<li>Rendersettings will be used as defined in the active scene where the archive process was started. </li>
				<li>Rendered as set in render settings of the initial scene the addon is started from. However, different Colormanagement, Postprocessing, in different scenes will not be homogeniesded </li>
				<li>In addition, using any Gizmos will also change the settings in the panel, too. This can also allow to figure out, what (the heck) 'this' gizmo does.</li>
				<li>All sequences will be rendered independent of the set frame range. However, strips in negative frame range not get rendered.</li>
