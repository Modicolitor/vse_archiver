    [] remove fade for render and reapply after render (mainstrip, but also effect strips)
    [] add frames to bgeinning and end of the sequences (scheint anstrengend wenn man kurz drüber nachdenkt)

    [] use scene render settings (also for the other scenes)
    
    [] individual sequence list where you can per element decide whether copy or render
    [] ui toggle 
    [] ui active and general fiels 

    [] absolut path from relative path for archiv folder

    [] test scene render stuff
    
    [] back to original scene after snippets
what else could be missing:

[] does it work with metastrips? 
[] scene strips --> render out ? 
[] strips in other scene
[] negativ frame starts when rendering

todo
[] prompt when path is relative or compensate 
[] poll for path is relativ

[] check compositor for used files
[] check movieclip editor 
[] handle scene strips
[] fade 
[] ignore hiden strips

is footage only used in metastrip --> ignore about when render_metastrip = True
