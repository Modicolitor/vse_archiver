    [+] render.image_settings.color_depthand more
    [?????seems to work] fade on metastrips lost when render inside 
    
    [-] negativ frames 
    
    [+] error message scrolled to the beginning
    [+]794 renderpath = renderpath + '.mp4'
    [+] scene returns "copy" check if scenes render inside
    [+] meta,scene snippets rendered without audio --> replacing metastrip with metastrip with the move and audio strip

    [+] polls for operators: not updated, no target path
    [+] initialis updates data 

    [+] weird path error catching
    [+] handle unavailable strips

    [+]is archiv for all scenes
    [+]end at scene you started from

Features 
????[] add frames to bgeinning and end of the sequences (scheint anstrengend wenn man kurz drüber nachdenkt)

[] related audio and movie zusammenrendern
[] fortschrittsbalken

[] ignore hiden strips option (I think he ignores them at the moment)
[] back to original scene after snippets
[] Decide rendering either with or without effect strips (at least a problem with time stretch)
[] render real audio files like mp3

[] image rendering as output not allowed because of rebuilding feature, coud be added (with check box )

[] warn if the rendersettings is set to an image format


what else could be missing: 
- caches? 




Test: 
[] negativ frame starts when rendering
[] test fade  for other than movie and audio
[] copy or render per Sequence
[+] use scene render settings of active scene (and copy to the other scenes?)
[] what if link to sequence lost in the file? 


todo
[] prompt when path is relative or compensate 
[] poll for path is relativ



is footage only used in metastrip --> ignore about when render_metastrip = True
